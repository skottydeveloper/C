### Payroll Management System
#### Summary
Keeping track of payment information is a hassle. Payment statements can be long, spread across multiple files which takes up storage and contain information such as bank addresses, residential addresses, payment amounts and other sensitive data. Working in a team of two, we created a payment information system to allow the user to keep track of their information.
