## Instructions
Thanks to the use of a makefile, it's easy to compile and run the the payroll management system program. The instructions are as of below:
1. In the terminal, type: "make clean". This will delete all the loaded files from the makefile's cache. 
2. In the terminal, then type: "make SecurePayroll.out". This will add all the loaded files to the makefile's cache.
3. To run the program, you need to supply a command line argument, this is either done by "./SecurePayroll.out -r" for user mode (allows you to run the program as per normal), or "./SecurePayroll.out -d" for debug mode (allows you to see additional things being printed, while going through all of the program's functionalities).
